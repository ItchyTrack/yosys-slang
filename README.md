# yosys-slang: SystemVerilog frontend for Yosys

yosys-slang is a Yosys plugin providing a new command (`read_slang`) for loading SystemVerilog designs.

yosys-slang builds on top of the [slang](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang) library to provide comprehensive SystemVerilog support.

The plugin is available prebuilt in

 * [OSS CAD Suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build) from YosysHQ, and

 * [IIC-OSIC-TOOLS](https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools) from Johannes Kepler University

## Status

*News:* The [Microelectronics Design Center](https://dz.ethz.ch/) at ETH ZÃ¼rich is now sponsoring yosys-slang development for usage in ASIC synthesis flows!

yosys-slang understands some synthesizable subset of SystemVerilog. For any user input, it should either emit a correct netlist (under synthesis semantics), or produce an error. If that's not the case, that's a serious bug.

To a user, the error messages can be cryptic and expose details about the inner workings of the frontend. Nonetheless they should point to the filename and line number with the offending input.

If you wish to sponsor the project's development, and prioritize certain features, please get in touch.

## Compatibility

yosys-slang can parse a number of premier open-source IPs, including:

 * [Black Parrot](https://github.com/black-parrot/black-parrot/)

 * [BSC Core Tile](https://github.com/bsc-loca/core_tile/)

 * [OpenHW Group's CV32E40P](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p)

 * [Ibex RISC-V Core](https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex)

 * [OpenTitan: Open source silicon root of trust](https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan)

 * [RSD RISC-V Out-of-Order Superscalar Processor](https://github.com/rsd-devel/rsd/)

For details see the [compat suite repository](https://github.com/povik/yosys-slang-compat-suite) which documents sample command lines.

yosys-slang is on the [CHIPS Alliance sv-tests dashboard](https://chipsalliance.github.io/sv-tests-results/) where failing test cases and their error messages (with useful line numbers and AST dumps!) can be browsed. Note some tests on the sv-tests dashboard are misconfigured for testing a synthesis tool.

## Building

*Prerequisities:*

 * Yosys installed

 * Usual toolchains, CMake

Check out the repository including the submodule, e.g. with

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/povik/yosys-slang

Then build both slang and the `build/slang.so` plugin for Yosys:

    make -j$(nproc)

Use a custom `-jN` switch to build with `N` concurrent processes instead of matching the number of cores.

## Usage

You load the plugin into Yosys on startup by passing the `-m` argument:

    $ yosys -m build/slang.so

Or, alternatively, you load the plugin at runtime with the `plugin` command:

    plugin -i build/slang.so

The frontend is invoked with the `read_slang` command. The command accepts standard slang options, see `help read_slang` and [slang documentation](https://www.sv-lang.com/command-line-ref.html).

Sample usage:

    read_slang picorv32.v --top picorv32 -D DEBUG
